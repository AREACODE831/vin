   Title: Warm Rescue
<br>
   Year: 2021<br>
   Medium: Maya, 1920 x 1080px<br>
   <br>
   Description: <Br>
     I feel lonely as an international student who does not have any family to rely on not only the whole time in the United States but also during Covid-19. I greatly missed a noisy dinner with someone. Indeed, humanism, affection, and compassion were needed.
  There was news that the dog saved a blacked-out person by laying next to her, sharing warmth with her for two days. What if there is a prosthetic for human beings who need another human being to hold their hands and tell them that everything is okay? I wanted to bring that news and personal experience to my prosthetic project, Warm Rescue. A person can wear the bracelet, and Warm Rescue will get to you whenever you touch the bracelet: 365 days & 36.5°C support.
  <br><br>Since I desired a “warm” atmosphere with other human beings, I brought the human temperature, 36.5°C, to the prosthetic object to express support. Then, I scanned my hand gesture, trying to make a person stand and made it a giant hand to show its big support and precious existence. Moreover, I wanted this prosthetic object to be shown as a lifeguard, so I scanned a laying person reaching out for Warm Rescue for the dramatic scene. Furthermore, Warm Rescue offers a flowery environment and sweet cake with coffee because these are everyday lifesavers to most people. To sum up, it is a warm, soothing package for a person who called Warm Rescue for help. <br><br>
  The obstacle I had was not getting a clean body scan due to not having a face-id cell phone; then, I got a Kinect from eBay and finally got it scanned after many trials. Getting hand scanned was challenging, yet, I wore a dishwashing rubber glove and got it scanned. Thus, it came out with more movement features and vitality.

   Title: Your Parking Lot<br>
   Year: 2021<br>
   Medium: Maya, 3840 x 2160<br>
   <br>
   Description: <Br>
   Here is your FREE parking lot with joy! I liked to create an installation space where I could bring the audience’s happy, fun but aesthetic experience from twisting the usual space in the virtual space. Thus, I made a vivid virtual space of a parking lot romantically visualized with decorating of carpet, mirrorball, ocean wave, and free parking lot sign—transforming the daily visited place into the art space with the juxtaposition of realistic, unrealistic characteristics.

   Title: Me On The Cutting Board_stopmotion<br>
   Year: 2020<br>
   Medium: Digital Photo transfer on the cutting board and Video(stop motion)<br>
   <br>
   Description: <Br>
   There is a phrase, "you are on the people's cutting board," in Korea, which means you are the target<br>
    from people to talk about, criticize about or pick on. As an international student, as a woman who has an opinion,<br>
   and as an artist, most of the time I am the one who is on people's cutting boards.<br>
   They are so ready judge me whenever they got bored from their lives.<br>

   <br>
   Cutting photos of me taken from California, and the action of "cutting" represents how people criticize on me <br>
   by my personality, my friendship, my education, my lifestyle, and my success. <br>
   To express the remaining stuff(smell or color) from cutting fruit or vegetables on the cutting board,<br>
    I spreaded gel medium on the cutting board, and put a photo print on top, then ripped it off. <br>
    Thus, only ink remains on the cutting board. This method is called digital photo transfer. <br>
    I tried to explore alternative process photography. In addition, I made a stop motion video to add more to the project.

   Title: Polaris<br>
   Year: 2020<br>
   Medium: Full HD Color Video, 00"00"55<br>
   Description: <br>
   Year:2020

Description:<br>
I find my way by looking up my own Polaris.<br>
Inspired from one of my favorite poems, "The Night I Count the Stars" by Korean poet, Dong-ju Yoon.<br>
"...<br>
To a star memory<br>
To a star love<br>
To a star loneliness<br>
To a star yearning<br>
To a star poem<br>
To a star mother, mother<br>
<br>
Mother, I whisper a beautiful word to a star.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
They are too far away.<br>
As far as the stars<br>

   Title: Glitch-ish<br>
   Year: 2020<br>
   Medium: Full HD Color Video, 00"00"55<br>
   Description: <br>
   It is one minute collage video art.
   <br>
    A square format video mixed with my digital art works. <br>
   I wanted to practice in controlling the effects panel, so I tried many different effects on Premiere.<br>
   Used Ultra key for getting rid of the green part from greenscreen footage, RGB adjustment for vhs effect, and adjusted keyframes. <br>

   <br>
   Since glitch is such a fun part of digital arts, I cut out some little parts of the video,<br>
   so it can look like a glitched video. Used Touch Designer for making distorted videos(pink dolphin and my drawing).<br>
   Like I mentioned from previous project that I did, nowadays people's index fingers do everything: web surfing, <br>
   send messages, confirm the meeting, etc. I edited index fingers in to human body and earth because of that reason. <br>
   "Digital" is everywhere, and humans are everywhere.

   Title: Blue Bird<br>
   Year: 2020<br>
   Medium: Photoshop, Premiere, Max msp, Blippar<br>
   Description: In many countries, the blue bird is a symbol of happiness, joy, and enlightenment. <br>
   “Bluebirds are always a symbol of something good that is about to come into your life (Dreaming and Sleeping).” <br>
   Also, there is a song in Korea, Bluebird by Lee Moon-sae, which is about letting<br> your loved ones go if you love them. Even though you love the bird, the bird would be happier <br>if they could “fly.” My mom said that blue bird reminds her daughter, me, because my mom had to let me go to support my dream. <br>

   <br>
   However, the blue bird means a lot to me, and in this pandemic time,<br>
    it is the time we need to think about a hopeful subject. <br>
    Therefore, I created a blue bird hanging out on the leaf that has a colorful <br>
    glitch-ish video in it. I used Max2 and Touch designer to make that video.<br>

   If you touch the ball shape, it leads to Vimeo. <br>
   And when you touch 삐릿삐릿 파랑새(lyrics of the song), it gives you youtube video of <br>Blue bird, song by Lee Moon-sae.<br>

   -쉼 means "taking a break."<br>

   -삐릿삐릿 파랑새  is my favorite lyric from that Blue bird song.  <br>

       Title: Video Presentation Flow: Past VS Present <br>
       Year:2020<br>
       Description:<br>
       "...video was initially used as a handy and low-cost tool to document live <br>
       performances that had no mobility or permanence, thereby making these forms <br>transportable and more accessible to audiences beyond the original site of <br>presentation." (Busting the Tube: A Brief History of Video Art)  <br>
       In 2020, if the video is boring, people start to look up different video immediately, <br>
       unlike 1960s or 1970s. Wanted to show how we differently see the video art, and <br>
       how we differently present to the audience in different flow depending on the <br>
       period(ex. one-take shot vs fast transition).<br>
